# Machine-Learning
This project is a regression model to predict used automobile prices using XgBoost and Linear regression algorithms. It comprises of data cleaning, EDA, data preparation, data preprocessing and modeling.

The files contain:
1. File F_XG_Boost.ipynb contains the XGBoost model.
  
2. File MainFile_LinearRegression.ipynb contains the data cleaning, data processing, EDA and Linear Regression modeling part.

3. File LinearRegressionAssumptions contains the code which checks if our data fulfills the assumptions that are crucial for a Linear Regression model.
   These assumptions are:
   a. Linearity: The dependent and independent variables should have a linear relationship.
   b. Normality of Error: The error terms should follow normal distribution.
   c. No Multicolinearity: Linear regression assumes that there is little or no multicollinearity in the data
   d. No autocorrelation of error terms: There should be no correlation between the error terms.
   e. Homoscedasticity: This assumes that the residuals are equal across the regression line.
